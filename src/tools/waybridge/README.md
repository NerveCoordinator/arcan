Introduction
====
This tool bridges wayland connections with an arcan connection point. It is
currently in a beta- state and should be useful, but expecting quirks and
side-effects to exist.

Building/Use
====
The build needs access to the arcan-shmif and arcan-shmifext libraries,
either detected through the normal pkgconfig or by explicitly pointing
cmake to the -DARCAN\_SOURCE\_DIR=/absolute/path/to/arcan/src

The appl- that arcan is running also needs to expose an approriate connection
point (some, like durden and prio expose this as an ARCAN\_CONNPATH env in
instances of the terminal emulator) and you need to set the appropriate
XDG\_RUNTIME\_DIR for both Waybridge and for any Wayland clients you wish to
connect to the point.

         mkdir build
         cd build
         cmake ../
         make
         XDG_RUNTIME_DIR=/tmp arcan-wayland

The build-scripts will download additional protocol specifications from the
wayland-protocols repository the first time the build is setup. If there's
no internet connection at that time, build will fail.

Hacking
====
The code has a somewhat odd structure:

    waybridge.c - setup and allocation/routing
    boilerplate.c - structures and tables
    shmifevmap.c - translate from arcan -> bridge/client/surfaces
    wlimpl/* - subprotocol function implementations

Some subprotocol implementations (those that call request\_surface)
also attach separate event handlers that override the mapping done in
shmifevmap.c. See also the part in the CMakeLists.txt that takes unstable
protocols and generate implementation files.

The main paths to follow to get some kind of comprehension of what is going
on is how surfaces are allocated and how the surface allocation request are
propagated.

To debug, add the -trace level argument and a call trace to stderr will be
added that cover (based on level argument bitmask, so add the values):

    1   - allocations only
    2   - digital input events
    4   - analog input events
    8   - shell (wl\_shell, xdg\_shell, ...) events
    16  - region events
    32  - data-device events
    64  - seat events
    128 - surface events
		256 - drm (accelerated buffers)
		512 - alerts

Allocation outputs are encoded as follows:

    'C' - client-bridge connection
    'S' - shell surface
    's' - shell subsurface
    'm' - pointer surface
    't' - xdg- toplevel surface
    'p' - xdg- popup surface
    'x' - dead
    'o' - unused

Then the correlated arcan events can be traced with ARCAN\_SHMIF\_DEBUG=1

All individual protocols can be disabled by the -no-(protocol alias) switch
in order to control client behavior as this may vary wildly from client
to client depending on the set of requested vs. available protocols.

Notes and Issues
====
1. Stride - The shm- buffer blit doesn't take stride differences into
   account. This fails on MPV in SHM depending on source video size, though
   the other buffer transfer modes and the shm-to-gl approach works.

2. Initial Control connection - this one should be deprecated and removed
   in favor of getting it from the client connection when it is created, the
   current form is a remnant from before the -exec refactor.

3. Dynamic resizes are a bit edgy due to how differently this stage is handled
   in arcan and the 'idea' in Wayland. This will be fixed when the 'conductor'
   refactoring in arcan finishes.

Depending on what toolkit is being used, chances are that some magic dance is
needed in order to get a client to connect using wayland, and similarly for the
specific shell protocol to use when multiple are available, for the choice of
buffer passing (shm or egl) and for the GPU device actually being used. With
other Wayland compositors, chances are that this effect is masked by the client
in question falling back to XWayland and some clients will fail outright if
there's no XServer available even though the clients themselves actually only
use their respective Wayland paths. In short, it's a mess.

a. For SDL, check the environment variable for SDL\_VIDEODRIVER=wayland
b. For QT, try the -platform wayland argument.
c. For EFL, it's EVAS\_ENGINE=wayland\_shm or EVAS\_ENGINE=wayland\_egl along
with ELM\_DISPLAY=wl and optionally ELM\_ACCEL=none if there's issue with
gl acceleration.

The -exec mode sets these automatically.

Limitations
====
There are a number of arcan features that do not have a corresponding
Wayland translation, and will therefore be a no-op or hidden in whatever
scripts arcan is running. There are also some features where the translation
is not entirely compatible. Such incompatibilities/limitations are tracked
separately in the [arcan wiki](https://github.com/letoram/arcan/wiki/wayland).

XWayland
====
There are two ways of getting X support for Arcan. One is via the custom
arcan backend to the xserver that is part of the XArcan setup. The other
is by using XWayland, both has their respective tradeoffs.

XWayland can be used in two modes, rootless and redirected. The redirected one
works 'transparently' but requires the Wayland side to implement a window
manager. Weston et. al does this by pulling in all of xcb etc. into the
compositor itself. This approach is not used here due to the poor separation
that encourages.

Here, the wm is built as a separate binary, arcan-xwayland-wm. It is in an
early state, and will have a variant that supports the durden control socket
for communicating events, and one that works transparently from the arcan-
wayland bridge.


To experiment with the XWayland rootless support, try this setup:

    arcan-wayland -exec Xwayland -rootless
		DISPLAY=:0 arcan-xwayland-wm
		DISPLAY=:0 xterm

BUGS
===
1. gnome-apps, mouse motion registers but not button presses on some
   popups, likely related to input regions and grabbing and the WM
	 script-side being guilty.
2. SDL2, buffer- size and mouse cursor alignment is off in ex. 0ad
3. gnome-apps, visible with calculator - some interaction between durden
   and subsurfaces etc. still seem to misbehave.
4. The defunct wl- shell protocol is still in use in places like SDL2,
   except the protocol lacks options for communicating when a shutdown
   is initiated server-side, or it goes into a spinlock EXCEPT if some
   Qt specific protocols are present

TODO
====

Rough estimate of planned changes and order:

1. Xwayland
2. input fixes (regions, D to A mouse wheel, ...)
3. data-device to clipboard
4. enforce stronger error handling (not allow surfaces to switch roles etc.)
5. move more 'decisions' that is part of the durden atype handling
6. make a simple automatable wayland-only WM appl

+ (for-each finished milestone, verify allocation/deallocation/validation)

The many 'p's are simply that we lack a decent conformance suite to actually
